-----------------------------------------------------------------Demo of The Raven-----------------------------------------------------------------
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,--- {'neg': 0.481, 'neu': 0.519, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7506}
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—--------- {'neg': 0.156, 'neu': 0.656, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.1027}
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.231, 'compound': 0.4588}
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—---- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
            Only this and nothing more.”------------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;------ {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.-- {'neg': 0.187, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow--- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.224, 'compound': 0.3818}
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—- {'neg': 0.204, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—----- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.763, 'pos': 0.237, 'compound': 0.4767}
            Nameless here for evermore.-------------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain {'neg': 0.398, 'neu': 0.602, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6486}
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;-- {'neg': 0.224, 'neu': 0.373, 'pos': 0.404, 'compound': 0.4404}
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating {'neg': 0.165, 'neu': 0.604, 'pos': 0.231, 'compound': 0.296}
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—--- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
            This it is and nothing more.”------------------------ {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,-- {'neg': 0.348, 'neu': 0.455, 'pos': 0.197, 'compound': -0.25}
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;------ {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.615, 'pos': 0.385, 'compound': 0.6124}
    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.306, 'compound': 0.743}
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;— {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.2551}
            Darkness there and nothing more.--------------------- {'neg': 0.333, 'neu': 0.667, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.25}
    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, {'neg': 0.388, 'neu': 0.612, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6908}
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;-- {'neg': 0.301, 'neu': 0.392, 'pos': 0.307, 'compound': 0.0258}
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, {'neg': 0.219, 'neu': 0.781, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4215}
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
            Merely this and nothing more.------------------------ {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.-------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice; {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—-------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.296, 'compound': 0.6369}
            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”--------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;---- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.1695}
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—-------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.------------------ {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,-------- {'neg': 0.22, 'neu': 0.567, 'pos': 0.213, 'compound': -0.0258}
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,------- {'neg': 0.206, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven, {'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.727, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.0258}
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—- {'neg': 0.291, 'neu': 0.709, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5719}
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”------------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;---------- {'neg': 0.224, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1868}
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being------- {'neg': 0.481, 'neu': 0.519, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6698}
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.719, 'pos': 0.281, 'compound': 0.5994}
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,--- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
            With such name as “Nevermore.”----------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only- {'neg': 0.245, 'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5023}
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.--- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before— {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.763, 'pos': 0.237, 'compound': 0.4767}
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”-- {'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.733, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.3818}
            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”---------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,--- {'neg': 0.375, 'neu': 0.625, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5859}
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster----- {'neg': 0.535, 'neu': 0.465, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7845}

            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”------------------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,----- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.692, 'pos': 0.308, 'compound': 0.6124}
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.2263}
    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking---- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—--- {'neg': 0.234, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4118}
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore {'neg': 0.404, 'neu': 0.596, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7269}
            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”----------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing--- {'neg': 0.221, 'neu': 0.632, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': -0.2382}
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;---- {'neg': 0.179, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34}
    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.682, 'pos': 0.318, 'compound': 0.5667}
    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}

The directing seems too pretentious.  --------------------------- {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}

There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.   {'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.921, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4466}

I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.   {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}

This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.   {'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.184, 'compound': 0.8957}
